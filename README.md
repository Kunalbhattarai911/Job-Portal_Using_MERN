Welcome to the Rojgar Sewa app!
This app was developed by learning Node.js and React.js.
The app has two user roles:
    1.) Seeker: A seeker can search for jobs, apply to them, and manage their applications.
    2.) Recruiter: A recruiter can post job openings, review applicants, and approve or reject seekers based on their qualifications.
    
One major limitation of this project is the absence of an admin panel, allowing any recruiter to act as an admin.

To run this project on your device, follow these steps:
   1.) Install Node.js on your device. If it's already installed, proceed to the next step.
   2.) Install the required packages by running npm install in both the frontend and backend directories.
   3.) Create a .env file in the backend directory with the following variables:
        MONGO_URI
        PORT
        SECRET_KEY
        CLOUD_NAME
        API_KEY
        API_SECRET
    4.) Run the app by opening the terminal and entering npm run dev in both the frontend and backend directories.


Thank you for using the Rojgar Sewa app! We hope this project helps in connecting seekers with the right job opportunities and recruiters with qualified candidates. While the absence of an admin panel is a known limitation, the app is fully functional for managing job postings and applications.

Feel free to explore the project and contribute to its development. Any feedback or suggestions are welcome!
